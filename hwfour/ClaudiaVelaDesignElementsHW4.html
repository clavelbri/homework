<h1>Design Elements Homework 4 </h1>

 <h2> <a href="https://www.haring.com/"> 
 1. The Keith Haring Foundation website - Contrast
    </a> </h2>
<h3> The Keith Haring Foundation website is a good example of the use of contrast: </h3>
<ul>
<li>The colors on the main page create effective contrast that is representative of <br> Keith Haring's artwork</li>

<br>
<br>
<li>The colors red, black and white pop against one another and capture the viewer's attention</li>

<br>
<br>
<li>The use of text boxes with sharp corners create visual tension against the smooth edges of <br>Haring's characters in his paintings</li>

<br>
<br>

</ul>

<br>
<br>
<h2> <a href="https://easyplant.com/"> 2. Easy Plant website - Repetition</a> </h2>
<h3> The Easy Plant website uses repetition to maintain consistency in their design style: </h3>
<ol>
  <li>The muted color pallete and filter is repeated throughout the website</li>

  <br>
  <br>
  <li>The repetition of the same font makes the website simple and easy to navigate</li>

  <br>
  <br>
  <li>The images of the plants all stick to the same size, pallete, filter and similar background style</li>

  <br>
  <br>
  <li>The repetition of all these elements help to create identity and unique style</li>

</ol>

<h2> <a href="https://www.goodbooks.io/books"> 3. Good Books website - Alignment </a> </h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Goodbooks.io uses alignment to give the website a sense of organization: </dt>
  <dd> -Left-alignment of text elements can be seen all throught the website,<br>
   including the individual book description pages.</dd>

  <br>
  <br>
  <bre>
  <dt>Edge alignment is also used: </dt>
  <dd>-Images of books and people featured on the website are positioned <br>
   against a margin that matches up with their outer edges</dd>
</dl> 
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52003544100_1e8de4f35c_m.jpg">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<dt> The Goodbooks logo uses left-side alignment as well as repetition:</dt>
<dd>- Each letter on the two lines of the logo is aligned, the "s" on the word <br>
  "books" hangs off to the right but is balanced by the empty space above<br>
  the block design </dd>

  <h2> <a href="https://hostdefense.com/"> 4. Host Defense website - Proximity </a> </h2>
  <h3> The Host Defense website makes good use of proximity in its design, <br>making it easy for users to navigate through and find the information they need:</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>The white space between Host Defense's logo and the menu options on the right<br> effectively separate the logo, giving it the presence it needs and also grouping the hyperlinks  </li>
  <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52003671271_843ea565fe_m.jpg">
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>The website effectively groups like topics together and has plenty of white space <br>between the groups. This white space is very important to give the site a clean and <br>organized look for a better user experience.</li>
  <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52002668052_0a5f02a20a_m.jpg"><br><br>
  <li>Different product types are grouped with the description below their image and a "shop" button, <br>this gives the customer confidence that they are purchasing the right product </li>
