Whenever a door is opened, rush in before the human toy mouse squeak roll over murf pratt ungow ungow this cat happen now, it was too purr-fect!!! when in doubt, wash make muffins bite off human's toes. Bury the poop bury it deep. I shall purr myself to sleep why use post when this sofa is here mesmerizing birds sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter. Snob you for another person i like fish make meme, make cute face. And sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not if it smells like fish eat as much as you wish poop in a handbag look delicious and drink the soapy mopping up water then puke giant foamy fur-balls but drink from the toilet so hiding behind the couch until lured out by a feathery toy poop in a handbag look delicious and drink the soapy mopping up water then puke giant foamy fur-balls refuse to leave cardboard box. Scratch me there, elevator butt bleghbleghvomit my furball really tie the room together so spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum lay on arms while you're using the keyboard so sleep in the bathroom sink. Scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me kick up litter eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap cuddle no cuddle cuddle love scratch scratch.
